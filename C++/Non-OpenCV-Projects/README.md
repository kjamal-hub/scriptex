1. [find_duplicate.cpp](https://github.com/kjamal-hub/scriptex/blob/master/C%2B%2B/Non-OpenCV-Projects/find_duplicate.cpp) is a script that finds the duplicate number in the provided array using **Floyd's Tortoise and Hare Principle** which has a tricky algorithm, yet has a better approach to finding duplicates. As it uses 0(1) extra space and time complexity is only 0(n).

2. [generatePi.cpp](https://github.com/kjamal-hub/scriptex/blob/master/C%2B%2B/Non-OpenCV-Projects/generatePi.cpp) is a script that finds the number Pi by generating uniform random numbers between 0-1. Its an interesting logical script.
