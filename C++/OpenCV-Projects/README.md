1. [webcam_1.cpp](https://github.com/kjamal-hub/scriptex/blob/master/C%2B%2B/OpenCV-Projects/webcam_1.cpp) is a basic script just to open up your webcam, but can be used as small but powerful part of a bigger **Code**.

2. [face_detect_1.cpp](https://github.com/kjamal-hub/scriptex/blob/master/C%2B%2B/OpenCV-Projects/face_detect_1.cpp) is a basic **face detection** script, that can detect multiple faces at a time. Its a good script, use it and see it how awesome this script is yourself.
