# C++ Projects

+  All my C++ project scripts can be found in here.

+ All my projects are made in [CodeBlocks v20.03](http://www.codeblocks.org/downloads/26) as of now.

+ I use [OpenCV v4.4.0](https://codeload.github.com/opencv/opencv/zip/4.4.0), the releases can be found [here](https://opencv.org/releases/). Any 4.x.x version will suffice. The link to the tutorial on how to install it in CodeBlocks(Windows 7/10) is on [medium.com](https://medium.com/@sourabhjigjinni/install-opencv-4-0-0-for-c-windows-7-10-code-blocks-tdm-gcc-64-dff65addf162).
