# C++ Projects

+  All my C++ project scripts can be found in here.

+ All my projects are made in [CodeBlocks v20.03](http://www.codeblocks.org/downloads/26) as of now or CLION(Student's Edition) for macOS.

+ I use [OpenCV v4.5.3](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/releases/tag/4.5.3), the releases can be found [here](https://opencv.org/releases/). Any 4.x.x version will suffice. The link to the tutorial on how to install it in CodeBlocks(Windows 7/10) is on [medium.com](https://medium.com/@sourabhjigjinni/install-opencv-4-0-0-for-c-windows-7-10-code-blocks-tdm-gcc-64-dff65addf162).

+ Installing OpenCV on CodeBlocks(on Linux) is a bit different and difficult. So I suggest you to install and build it by reading [this](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d7/d9f/tutorial_linux_install.html), and install **CLion**. It will make the process a less of a hassle, and will surely save a lot of time.

+ Installing OpenCV on macOS is simple though.
